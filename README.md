# Recipes Research Project
by Tatiana Samokhvalova

_This project was created as an assignment for UCSD's DSC 80 class in Winter 2024._

## Introduction

In this project, I dive into an extensive dataset comprising detailed information on a wide variety of recipes and user interactions with these recipes. This dataset contains a variety of factors such as preparation time, nutritional values, step-by-step instructions, user reviews, and other. My investigation centeres around the relationship between the recipes' different features and their preparation times.
